# Table Tennis
## How did you first start playing table tennis? What did you do to improve?
I usually live in an apartment in Korea. 
There’s a government-managed gym in front of my house, 
and I often play table tennis there—about twice a week, 
once during the weekdays and once on the weekend. 
I first started playing table tennis 
because I enjoyed it with my colleagues at work. 
When I'm programming and a problem doesn’t get solved easily or when I’m overthinking, 
I started playing to refresh my mind.

## 탁구의 규칙
I'm going to explain the rules of table tennis
The game is played to 11 points, with a player needing at least a 2-point lead to win.
Each player serves two consecutive points, alternating until the game ends.
The serve must be tossed at least 6 inches and hit diagonally across the table.
A point is scored when the opponent fails to return the ball, or the ball touches the opponent's side of the table twice.
The ball must be returned after it bounces once on the server's side of the table.
Matches are usually best of five or seven games, depending on the competition.

## 탁구의 장점
Table tennis stands out among other sports for several reasons. 
First, it’s incredibly accessible, allowing people of all ages and fitness levels to participate, 
which makes it a highly inclusive activity. 
Unlike many sports that require large fields or courts, 
table tennis needs very little space, so it can be played almost anywhere, even indoors. 
It’s also a low-impact sport, meaning it’s easy on the joints, reducing the risk of injuries that are common in more physically demanding activities. 
The fast-paced nature of the game helps improve reflexes and hand-eye coordination, 
which are beneficial skills in many aspects of life. 
Finally, it’s a social sport that can be enjoyed casually with friends or competitively, making it enjoyable activity for many different settings.

To play table tennis, you need a few essential items. 
First and foremost, you need a table tennis table, which includes a net dividing the table into two equal halves. 
A good quality table is important for a smooth and consistent bounce of the ball. 
You’ll also need a table tennis paddle, often called a racket or bat, which typically has a rubber surface to provide grip and spin on the ball. 
The ball is a small, lightweight plastic ball that must meet specific size and weight standards. 
Comfortable, non-slip shoes are also important, as they help with quick movements and stability during the game. 
Finally, a suitable playing area with enough space around the table is necessary to allow players to move freely and return shots effectively. 
All these elements come together to create the right environment for an enjoyable and competitive game of table tennis.
