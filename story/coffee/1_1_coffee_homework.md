# Favorite coffee
I really enjoy iced soy milk lattes at coffee shops.
The combination of the smooth creamy soy milk with the espresso is just perfect.
I love how the ice keeps it refreshing especially on a warm day.
It's great choice when i'm looking for a drink.
This has become my go-to order whenever I visit a cafe.

# Memorable experience
one day, I ordered a watermelon juice at a cafe, but they brought me something else by mistake. 
I politely asked them to change it, and they immediately apologized for the mix-up. 
Not only did they replace the drink, but they also gave me a free coupon and didn’t charge me for the juice. 
The staff's kindness and professionalism made a strong impression on me. 
I left the cafe feeling really happy and appreciated. 
It turned a small mistake into a memorable experience.
