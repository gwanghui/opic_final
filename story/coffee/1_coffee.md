Do you Spend too much at cafes ordering overpriced skinny lattes?
Is it possible to get your coffee fix at home with a brew that a professional barista would be proud of? 

According to Sam Gardiner, The manager of an independent Sydney-based cafe, 
It isn't hard to make a coffee at at home that should satisfy even the most discerning palate.

The key to good coffee isn't expensive equipment. "Skip the machines with coffee pods"
She says. "They're bad for the environment and cost a fortune."

Sam's rule of thumbs is simple: if a coffee maker comes with plug, you don't need it
Complicated domestic espresso machines, laden with LED display panels and mysterious cleaning cycles might look trendy on your kitchen counter
but you'll get better results with a simple cafetiere or filter

Sam's Tips for Better Coffee
1) It's all about the beans! Beans start to go stale within a few days of being roasted.
Try to find beans that have a roasting date marked on the packet.

2) Don't buy pre-ground coffee.
Keep your beans in an airtight container and grind them when you're ready to brew your coffee

3) Be cafeful with the water temperature.
Boiling water is great for tea but will burn ground coffee.
After bolling the kettle, wait one minute before your pour.

4) For the best results, use a simple filter over a cup or pod.
Pour a little water at a time,
It's an easy way to control the strength and volume of your coffee
